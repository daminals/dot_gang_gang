Genetic Algorithm + dots

Heavily inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk (Code Bullet's guided AI Dot game example with notable revisions):

•Developer Mode
•Revised Mutation Rate
•Significantly Revised Reward System
•Displays Generation Number on Screen
•More coming soon


TODOs:

  //TODO: FIX MAZE GENERATION SO THAT ONLY ONE MAZE PER Y VALUE
  //TODO: ADD IN A TIMER AND INCREASE FITNESS BASED ON SHORTER TIME
